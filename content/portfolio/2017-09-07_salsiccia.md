Our take on the Italian classic.

<!--more-->

Some time ago I dropped by at my Italian colleague's office and
asked him for some pasta inspiration.
'Well,' he said, 'you can cook something with _salsiccia_,
which is basically an Italian _Bratwurst_ with fennel.
You can add some fresh fennel and red wine to make a nice pasta dish.'

Ok, I thought, that sounds great, let's hunt this sausage down!
This turned out to be fairly difficult, however:
It isn't available in your supermarket round the corner.
When I did find it, I decided to buy _salsiccia_ without fennel and spice it with fresh sage.

Today was the second time we cooked this dish and boy did we enjoy it.
So, what's our recipe?

We'll need _salsiccia_ without fennel, olive oil,
some garlic and onions, a couple of tomatoes as well as tomato paste,
fresh sage leaves, red wine and, of course, _linguine_.

First, boil _salsiccia_ for half a minute in order
to make it just _a little bit_ firmer on the outside. Don't overcook it!
Now, cool it down and cut into small bits. Put it aside.

In a pan, heat the olive oil and fry chopped garlic in it for a couple of seconds.
Add diced onions and tomatoes, _salsiccia_, tomato paste and a generous amount of red wine.
Let it simmer for some time, add sage leaves and serve it with _linguine_.
_Buon appetito!_
